# Atm-Machine
# Description
This program allows you to select wether you would like to deposit or withdrawal (cash back) from your account.
First you must select which action you would like to do first, then enter the amount in the prompted field.

# Improvements
A few improvements I made were to style the program a little better by adding some gradient backgrounds, box & text shadows,
and making the sizing and spacing between elements more pleasing for the user.
I also added a feature which will not allow the user to withdraw more then the current total amount in the account!
